# Shanmuga Sankar Balamurugan

I am a 2nd year Graduate student, pursuing my MS in Data Science at NJIT. I have worked accross multiple domains as a Data Scienctist for 3 years at Mu Sigma, ranging from the pharamaceutical industry to the energy industry. The list projects I have worked on cover the specturum of the Data Science field from Data Migration, Failure prediction.

My Interest:

Problem-solving has always been a great joy of mine, whether it be sports, math problems or solving puzzles like the Rubiks Cube. In many ways I have always felt Data Sicence is also very similar, where you identify a problem, define your hypothesis, do your cleaning and engineering of the data, perform EDA, and then applying suitable modelling techniques to get the desired result.
